Oxide Secret Manager is a secure and efficient platform designed to store and manage secret keys and environment variables. With advanced encryption, fine-grained access control, and detailed audit logs, it ensures that sensitive information remains protected. The platform integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines and development workflows, making it easy to manage secrets across different environments.

A future feature will allow users to compose environment files with variable mapping stored in the manager. By using Oxide Secret Manager, you agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, including the use of cookies to operate the site and enhance the service.
